"A single hidden layer neural network was selected as the model for the THR Risk Assessment Application. The model performed relatively well when compared to alternatives for two important parameters: Accuracy and Sensitivity. For a detailed comparison to other models, please see the Model Selection section. When using a tool based on a predictive model, it is important to understand the overall reliability of the model. As such, a detailed description of the Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificity of the model for each complication is provided.","All neural networks were trained on a dataset of over 400,000 THR cases including patient demographics and comorbidities. Based on this patient data, the models were then tested on a dataset over 150,000 patient records in order to estimate patient risk. The results of this test are shown here.","This risk profile has been estimated using a neural network trained on a dataset of over 400,000 THR surgery instances. Patient demographics and comorbidities have been weighted using backpropagation ensuring high overall accuracy and identification of high-risk cases. The single hidden layer neural network below was developed specifically for this complication using the neuralnet package and is the basis of the risk estimations provided. To learn more about the model, please see the About Model section.","NOTE: The models used were trained on an oversampled dataset. In such datasets, episodes resulting in complications are oversampled in order to train the neural network on a robust selection of positive outcome episodes. In this case, the original dataset had a ratio of roughly 100:1 (No-Complication:Complication). The resampled dataset on which the model was trained had a 1:1 ratio. While this improved the classification model substantially, it can also lead to an over estimation of risk. In order to adjust for the resulting overestimation of risk probabilities, the generated probabilities were mapped onto the true population using","The THR Risk Assessment model was trained and tested on a dataset of over 400,000 THR episodes recorded by Hospital Episode Statistics (HES), which provides access to inpatient data on all joint replacements performed in the English National Health Service (NHS). Overall, the percentage of surgeries that result in complications is under 2%. In order to create a model that would accurately detect the majority of episodes resulting in complications, resampling was done using SMOTE in order to oversample cases in which complications occurred post-surgery. While this can marginally decrease the overall accuracy of the model, it ensures that the model can identify positive complication outcomes more readily.","After the neural network model is trained on a subset of the original dataset, it is tested on a test set. The results of these tests can provide information on how well the model predicts the likelihood of complications. When the model runs through the test set, it makes a prediction at whether a particular episode resulted in a complication given the demographics and comorbidities of a patient. When it has run through all of the episodes, a confusion matrix is created. This indicates the number of true positives (TP) and trues negatives (TN) produced, as well as the number of false positives and false negatives.  To assess the model for each complication, three key characteristics are analyzed: Accuracy, Specificity, and Sensitivity.",Classification accuracy is defined as the number of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions (TP+TN/Total). We aim to maintain an accuracy no lower than 70%.,Classification specificity is also known as the true negative rate. This is the number of true negatives identified out of the total number of true negatives in the test set (TN/Total Negatives). Specificity rates below 70% were not acceptable for these models.,"Classification sensitivity is perhaps the most important characteristic for the THR Risk Assessment App. This is known as the true positive rate, identifying the true positive predictions out of the total number of positive outcomes in the test set (TP/Total Positive). This parameter is not usually predicted as well as accuracy or specificity because it requires identifying unique traits in patients that had a complication. Many complications tested resulted in extremely low true positive rates and therefore, only those with sensitivities above 40% were used in the THR Risk Assessment App.","Total Hip Replacement (THR) is a highly successful and cost-effective intervention with over 75,000 procedures performed a year. Major complications occur in 2% of procedures with the majority occurring in the first four post-operative days. Hospital episode statistics (HES) provides access to inpatient data on all joint replacements performed in the English National Health Service (NHS). Novel methods of analyzing this data can allow clinicians to plan intervention in the safest environment based on bespoke peri- and post-operative care pathways. This has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality, reduce healthcare costs through improved efficiency and safe care, and maximize benefit from THR.","The aim of this tool is to create a web-based application for calculating risk of complications following single total hip replacement surgery. Entry of simple patient demographics and co-morbidity data will produce an estimated risk profile for a range of complications, and will enable the clinician to tailor peri- and post-operative needs, and allow bespoke, patient-specific consent.","The 'Risk Assessment' tool can be used to obtain a risk profile for several different complications based on patient demographics and comorbidities. To use this tool, simply enter patient information in the information panel and click Estimate Risk in each complication tab to generate a risk profile for each complication.","In order to understand the underlying predictive model from which risk profiles are derived, further information regarding the characteristics of the neural networks (NNs) used as well as a comparison between NNs and other predictive modeling methods can be found in the About Model and Model Selection sections of the App.","1=Age, 2=Sex ,3= Chronic Ischemic Heart Disease, 4=Hyperthyroidism (HyperT), 5=Hypothyroidism(HypoT), 6=Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (IDDM), 7=Non-Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (NIDDM), 8=History of Circulatory Disease (HCD), 9=Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 10=Dementia (D), 11=Alzheimers (Alz), 12=Osteoporosis (Ost), 13=Hypercholesterolemia (HC), 14=Hemorrhagic Cerebrovascular Accident (HCVA), 15=Duodenal Ulcers (DU), 16= Hypertension (HT), 17=Atrial fibrillation (AF)","The Olden or 'Connection Weights' method for deriving variable importance first obtains the product of input-to-hidden layer and hidden-to-output layer connection weights between each input neuron and output neuron. It then sums the product across all hidden neurons in order to derive the estimated variable importance. In essence, this algorithm provides a useful and accurate method for quantifying how predictor variables contribute to the estimated risk.","CDiff=Clostridium Difficile, CIin30= Chest Infection in 30 Days, CVAin30= Cerebrovascular Accident in 30 Days,died90= Death in 90 Days, Dis18m= Dislocation within 18 months, DVTin90= Deep vein thrombosis within 90 days,MIin30 = Myocardial infarction within 30 days, PEin90 = Pulmonary embolism within 90 days,RFin30 = Renal Failure within 30 days, TIAin30 = Transient ischemic attack within 30 days","Neural Networks with one hidden layer were chosen as the underlying model for the THR Risk Assessment Application. While these models performed the best when compared to other machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest, their ability to correctly predict surgical risk varied by complication. Only complications for which             risk could be reliably assessed were included in the THR Risk Assessment Application.","Since models with high accuracy and high selectivity are desireable, the best models            for this particilar dataset should appear in the upper-righthand quadrand of these plots. These models all have accuracy over 70% and high selectivity compared with other tested machine learning models.","In order to select a model that was suitable for investigating the Hospital Episode Statistics dataset and predicting risk profiles, Logistic Regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), and Neural Networks (NN) with one and two hidden layers were used. For model selection, it was important that for each complication, the model was not only accurate, but also had high sensitivity (the ability to identify cases with complications). Because complications are rare, occurring in roughly 2% of patients, a model would be highly accurate (98%) by predicting a negative outcome for every episode, however, this model would have 0% selectivity. In order to explore how Neural Networks were selected          as the model of choice, select a complication below to compare the machine learning models."
