# About the model--------------------------------

AboutNN <-"A single hidden layer neural network was selected as the model for the THR Risk Assessment Application. The model performed relatively well
when compared to alternatives for two important parameter: Accuracy and Sensitivity. For a detailed comparison to other models, please see the Model Selection section.
When using a tool based on a predictive model, it is important to understand the overall reliability of the model. As such, a detailed description 
of the Accuracy, Sensitivity and Specificty of the model for each complication is provided."

AboutNNTrain<- "All neural networks were trained on a dataset of over 400,000 THR cases including patient demographics and comorbidies.
Based on this patient data, the models were then tested on a dataset over 150,000 patient records in order to estimate patient risk. The results
of this test are shown here."

aboutRisk<- 
  "This risk profile has been estimated using a neural networks trained on a dataset of over 400,000 THR surgery instances. 
  Patient demographics and comorbidies have been weighted using backpropogation ensuring high overall accuracy and identification of 
  high-risk cases. The single hidden layer neural network below was developed specifically for this complication using the neuralnet package
  and is the basis of the risk estimations provided. To learn more about the model, please see the About Model section."


riskLevels<-
  "A LOW risk outcome indicates that the neural network estimates a patient's probablity of having a complication to be
between 0-50%. A HIGH risk outcome indicates that the neural network estimates a patient's probablity of having a complication to be higher
than the high risk threshold set in the input panel. Any risk probability falling in between is considered MODERATE risk.
All risk estimates are based on a patients similarity to those who have suffered from compliation in the past."

riskNote<-"
NOTE: The LOW Risk category was broadly defined as being estimated as 0-50% probability because the models used were trained on an oversampled dataset. In
such datasets, episodes resulting in complications are oversampled in order to train the Neural Network on a robust selection of 
positive outcome episodes. In this case, the original dataset had a ratio of roughly 50:1 (No-Complication:Complication). The resampled dataset on which
the model was trained had a 2:1 ratio. While this improved the classification model substantailly, it can also lead to an over estimation of risk,
which is why the net has been widened for the LOW risk category. However, this should be taken into account for all risk estimates." 
  
exploringModel<- "The THR Risk Assessment model was trained and tested on a dataset of over 500,000 THR episodes recorded by Hospital Episode
  Statistics (HES), which provides access to inpatient data on all joint replacements performed in the English National Health Service (NHS).
  Overall, the percentage of surgeries that result in complications are under 2%. In order to create a model that would accurately detect a majority
of episodes resulting in complications, resampling was done using SMOTE in order to oversample cases in which complications occurred post surgery. While this
can marginally decrease the overall accuracy of the model, it ensures that the model can identify positive complication outcomes more readily."

aboutCM<- "After the neural network model is trained on a subset of the original dataset, it is tested on a test set. The results of
these test can provide information on how well the model predicts the likelyhood of complications. When the model runs through the test set,
it makes a guess at whether a particular episode resulted in a complication given the demographics and comorbidies of a patient. When it has run
through all of the episode, a confusion matrix is created. This indicates the number of true Positive (TP) and trues negatives (TN) produced, as well as the number
of false positives and false negatives.  To assess the model for each complication, three key charachteristics are analysed: Accuracy, Specificity, and Sensitivity."
  
accuracy<- "Classification accuracy is defined as the number of correct predictions out of the total number of predictions (TP+TN/Total).
We aim to maintain an accuracy no lower than 75%."

specificity<- "Classification specificity is also known as the true negative rate. This is the number of true negatives identified out of 
the total number of true negatives in the test set (TN/Total Negatives). Specificty rates below 75% were not acceptable for these models."

sensitivity<- "Classification sensitivity is perhaps the most important charchteristic for the THR Risk Assessment App. This 
is known as the true positive rate, identifying the true positive predictions out of the total number of positive outcomes in the test set (TP/Total Positive)
This parameter is not usually predicted as well as accuracy or specificty because it requires idenitifying unique traits in patients that
had a complication. Many complications tested resulted in extremely low true positive rates and therefore, only those with sensitivities above 
40% were used in the THR Risk Assessment App"

aboutTHRbackground<-
  "Total Hip Replacement (THR) is a highly successful and cost-effective intervention with over 75,000 procedures performed a year. Major complications occur in 2% 
of procedures with the majority occurring in the first four post-operative days. Hospital episode statistics (HES) provides access to inpatient data on all joint 
replacements performed in the English National Health Service (NHS). Novel methods of analysing this data can allow clinicians to plan intervention in the safest environment 
based on bespoke peri- and post-operative care pathways. This has the potential to reduce morbidity and mortality, reduce healthcare costs through improved efficiency and safe care, 
and maximise benefit from THR. "

appObjective<-
  "The aim of this tool is to create a web-based application for calculating risk of complications following hip replacement. 
Entry of simple patient demographics and co-morbidity data will produce an estimated risk profile for a range of  complications, and will enable the clinician to tailor peri- and post-operative 
needs, and allow  bespoke, ‘patient-specific’ consent."

riskAssessment <-
  "The 'Risk Assessment' tool can be use to obtain a risk profile for several different complications based on patient demographics
and comorbidities. To use this tool, simply enter patient information in the information panel and click 'Estimate Risk' in each 
complication tab to generate a risk profile for each complication."

exploreModel<-
  "In order to understand the underlying predictive model from which risk profile's are derived, further information regarding the characteristics of the neural networks (NNs) used 
as well as a comparison between NNs and other predictive modeling methods can be found in the 'About Model' and 'Model Selection' sections of the App."
